            <h2>Forex Market</h2>
            <p>The Forex market, or foreign exchange market, is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, where currencies are traded. It operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, providing traders with continuous opportunities.</p>
            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> The value of one currency in terms of another. For example, if the EUR/USD exchange rate is 1.20, it means 1 Euro can be exchanged for 1.20 US Dollars.</li>
                <li><strong>Bids and Offers:</strong> In Forex, the bid is the price at which a trader can sell a currency, and the offer (or ask) is the price at which they can buy a currency.</li>
                <li><strong>Left Bid / Right Offer Rule:</strong> The left side of a quote represents the bid price, while the right side represents the offer price.</li>
                <li><strong>Interbank Market:</strong> The network of banks that trade currencies among themselves. It is where the bulk of Forex transactions occur, characterized by large volumes and low spreads.</li>
                <li><strong>Retail Market:</strong> The market segment where individual traders participate, often through online platforms. Retail traders typically trade smaller volumes compared to institutional investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Desk Dealing Brokers:</strong> Brokers that execute trades directly on behalf of their clients, often acting as market makers.</li>
                <li><strong>ECN Brokers:</strong> Electronic Communication Network brokers facilitate direct trading between market participants and do not take the other side of trades, leading to greater transparency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Important Formulas:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exchange Rate Conversion:</strong> <code>Amount in Currency B = Amount in Currency A × Exchange Rate (A/B)</code></li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Exchange Rate:</strong> <code>EUR/GBP = EUR/USD / GBP/USD</code></li>
                <li><strong>Spread:</strong> <code>Spread = Offer Price - Bid Price</code></li>
            </ul>
